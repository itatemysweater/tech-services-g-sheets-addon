This project (MatchMARC) is a Google Sheets Add-on created for the Lehigh University Libraries technical services team.
<br><br>
I collaborated on this project with Lehigh's Cataloging/Metadata Librarian, Lisa McColl, who helped me understand the needed functionality.  She did all of the testing and provided feedback for each iteration of the project.
<br><br>
We co-presented a session about this project to the ALA Technical Services Workflow Efficiency Interest group during the American Library Association's 2019 annual conference. You can view our slides here: https://connect.ala.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=3a69473d-a4a3-4781-a546-72b394ef3886
<br><br>
We co-authoring an article about the project in the November 2019 issue of the code4lib journal.  
<br><br>
This add-on is publicly available using the “Add-ons > Get add-ons” menu in any Google Sheet. A search for MARC will show the add-on.
