This is a beta version of a Google Apps Script I created for our library technical services team who maintain the items in the library catalog.  It is used as a Google Sheets add-on.
<br>
The script expects ISBN numbers in column #1 and LCCN numbers in #2.  Using those identifiers it looks up records using a vendor provided API.
<br>
Based on the options configured within the spreadsheet (in a config tab) it selects the best matched record and writes the details of the record to the spreadsheet.
<br>
I collaborated on this project with Lehigh's Metadata Librarian who helped me understand the needed functionality.  She did all of the testing and provided feedback for each iteration.
<br>
We will be co-presenting a session about this project to the ALA Technical Services Workflow Efficiency Interest group during the American Library Associations's 2019 annual conference.
